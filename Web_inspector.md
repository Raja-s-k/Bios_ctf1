### Description

one challenge, two flags!!

### Solution

To solve this challenge I **inspected** the given website by clicking
on inspect. I got both the flags. But could not submit the first 
flag due to some technical error in the server side. I found the 
first flag in the code section below the header tag. And the for the 
second flag I went to CONSOLE section.
