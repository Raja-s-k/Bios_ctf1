Decipher the ciphertext

### Solution

On reading the description it is clear that the qn is something related to encryption and 
decryption. When I saw the audio file I am sure that it can be decoded by morse decorder.
I decoded both the file first but still I feel like I am struck inbetween. I took a look on all encryption
software provided in the given hint finally found **Vigen√®re and Gronsfeld Ciphers** the correct
one and got the correct flag. It took nearly 1 1/2 to solve this challenge.

 
### Flag

The flag which i got is ictf{oahhtweoyymnagutwc}
