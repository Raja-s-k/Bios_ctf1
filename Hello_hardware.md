### Description

Can yu make the output high?

### Solution

I implemented the concept of **reverse engineering** i.e., I examined the circuit from **last to first**.
 On seeing the circuit first time I thought it is some what complicated. But even though I started to solve the circuit.
 Imessed some where while solving it for the first time. I got the value of **A B C D as 1 0 0 1** while solving it second time.
I gave the same to the [virtual hardware](https://wokwi.com/projects/334568130647949906) and got 
the correct flag.
