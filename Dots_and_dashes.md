### Description

Decrypt the audio to find the flag!!

## Solution

 To solve this CTF challenge i downloaded the audio file and just use [morse decoder](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html).

 **DECRYPTED STRING: **IEIIEIEINTEIÃžSDIFTEEITIISDISNENASITIEETTTTTAECC**ICTF R1CKR0113DONMRS3**

I found the ictf flag in the here but a letter "o" is not in caps. So, I changed
it to caps and submitted the flag.

## Flag

The flag i got is ICTF{R1CKR0113DONMRS3}
